# Lotion

This project is a clone of the popular productivity application Notion. It is built using React and npm, aiming to replicate some of the core functionalities and user interface elements of Notion.

This was my first React project I made in my Full Stack Web Dev course in second year of uni. I revamped it, taking care of many of the bugs and added some new features.
